Prime Factors Kata
============

# Instructions #

Write a class named "Calculator" that has one static method: Generate(). Generate accepts one integer argument and
returns a collection of integers. This collection contains the prime factors of the input argument in numeric sequence.

Write a suite of tests to produce this functionality.

**Hint:** Your first test might confirm that, given an input of one, Generate() returns an empty collection.
